Description: In ecology, spatial data is often represented using polygons. These
  polygons can represent a variety of spatial entities, such as ecological
  patches, animal home ranges, or gaps in the forest canopy.  Researchers often
  need to determine if two spatial processes, represented by these polygons, are
  independent of each other. For instance, they might want to test if the home
  range of a particular animal species is influenced by the presence of a
  certain type of vegetation.  To address this, Godoy et al. (2022)
  (<doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2022.100695>) developed conditional Monte Carlo
  tests. These tests are designed to assess spatial independence while taking
  into account the shape and size of the polygons.
